# LLM Input Preprocessing for Polish Airports

This is a machine learning project designed to **preprocess and filter input data for an LLM chatbot**.  
The goal is to classify and extract relevant textual information from large datasets scraped from online sources.  
This filtered data is then fed into a Large Language Model (LLM) to improve its performance and relevance during interactions.

## üß† Project Scope

- **Preprocessing and classification** of data for use with an LLM.
- Data was **scraped from public online sources** related to Polish airports.
- Data was manually categorized in order to correctly train model.
- Uses a machine learning model to **identify and extract only relevant information**.
- Designed to **support a larger system** created by two other developers by cleaning and filtering input data.

## ü§ù Collaboration

This project was created by **Micha≈Ç Niedbalski** on behalf of two developers working on a chatbot system for **Polish airports**.  
The task was to complement their system by providing clean, structured, and relevant input for the LLM.
